[SOURCE: ISO/IEC 10646:—, 4.8]

font

icon
symbol or combination of symbols in graphical user interfaces representing a function of the computer system

icon
object of manipulation of a function of the computer system through graphical user interfaces for computer applications
Note 1 to entry: Icons should be graphical representations that convey information with a minimum reliance on language.
Note 2 to entry: Icons have dynamic nature depending on the function of the computer system.
Note 3 to entry: Icons may be entirely abstract, such as graphical symbols, or pictorial, such as pictograms, or fall at some point between those extremes.

pictogram
simplified pictorial representation, used to guide people and tell them how to achieve a certain goal
[SOURCE: ITU-T Recommendation E.121, modified]
Note 1 to entry: Pictograms should be graphical representations that convey information with a minimum of reliance on language.
Note 2 to entry: Pictograms are, as far as possible, self-explanatory, and require little or no learning on the part of users.
Note 3 to entry: Pictorial representation can be two- or three-dimensional.

symbol
visual (audible or tactile) sign, single letter, numeral, punctuation mark each of which has a fixed meaning
Note 1 to entry: Symbols are usually graphical representations that convey information with little reliance on language.
Note 2 to entry: Symbols are usually abstract representations that stand for something, but that require learning on the part of users to take on their meaning.
Note 3 to entry: Examples of symbols are graphical symbols, graphic symbols, character symbols, chemical symbols, mathematical symbols, musical symbols, sex symbols, status symbols, tactile symbols and audible symbols.
