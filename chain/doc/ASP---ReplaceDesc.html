<h2>
The Backend
</h2>
<p>The backend of the Amsterdam SGML Parser is simple, but powerful
enough to create typeset documents from SGML documents. The user
can specify a mapping from each starttag with its attributes to a
replacement text, and a mapping from each endtag to a replacement text.
For example the mapping:
<pre>
&lt;title&gt;    ".TL"
&lt;head&gt;     ".NH [level]"
</pre>
<p>denotes that the starttag of the element 'title' is to be
replaced by the string '.TL', which is the Troff ms-macro
troff ms macro
for a title.
<p>The starttag of 'head' is to be replaced by the string '.NH'
followed by the value of the attribute 'level'.
Of course 'level' must be a valid attribute of 'head', otherwise
an error message is given.
<p>The replacement text stands between double quotes '"' and an attribute
value is referred to by placing the attribute name between square
brackets '[' and ']'.
<p>The <tt></tt> can be called with a user specified replacement file,
which contains the mapping for the tags in the DTD.
If a replacement file is specified, the tags in the output
are replaced according to the mappings in the replacement file.
Otherwise the 'complete' document will be output.
<p>For example, if the replacement file looks like:
<pre>
&lt;memo&gt;         ".MS"
&lt;sender&gt;       "From: "
&lt;forename&gt;     " "
&lt;receivers&gt;    "To: "
&lt;contents&gt;     ".PP"
&lt;/memo&gt;        ".ME"
</pre>
<p>The SGML document in figure 1 will be converted
to the Troff document in figure 2.
<p>Tags that are not mentioned in the replacement file are
mapped to the empty string and they do not appear in the output.
<pre>
&lt;memo&gt;&lt;sender&gt;

&lt;receivers&gt;

<p>It is possible to specify that the replacement text must appear on
a separate line.
<p>This is needed by Troff, since each Troff command must start with a '.'
at the start of a line.
<p>Provisions are made to make it possible to put any
(including non-printable) character in the replacement text.
This is done by an escape mechanism similar to that of
the C programming language.
<p>Our experience is that it is easy to convert an SGML document
to Troff or \*T, or some other similar looking code, to produce a typeset
document on paper.
<h2>
The replacement file
</h2><br>
<p>When a document parser is called, a replacement file may be specified.
The replacement file contains the mapping between starttags and their
attributes and endtags to some replacement text.
<p>The syntax of the file is given in figure 3.
We use the formalism of LLgen to describe the syntax.
Each identifier in uppercase is a token.
Text between '&lt;' and '&gt;' contains an informal description.
<pre>
%token COMMENT, PLUS, STRING_OPEN, STRING_CLOSE, ATT_OPEN, ATT_CLOSE,
       CHARACTER, EOLN, STAGO, ETAGO, TAGC;

%start file, file;
</pre>

<center>Figure 3: syntax of replacement file</center>

<pre>
file        : [repl | comment]* ;
comment     : COMMENT chars EOLN ;
repl        : start_repl | end_repl ;
start_repl  : starttag s* [PLUS s*]? rep_text [PLUS s*]? ;
end_repl    : endtag   s* [PLUS s*]? rep_text [PLUS s*]? ;
starttag    : STAGO name TAGC ;
endtag      : ETAGO name TAGC ;
rep_text    : [string s*]* ;
string      : STRINGOPEN [chars | attref]* STRINGCLOSE ;
chars       : CHARACTER* ;
attref      : ATTOPEN name ATTCLOSE ;
name        : &lt; SGML name &gt; ;
s           : &lt; layout characters: space, tab, newline, return &gt; ;
</pre>

<table border=5>
<caption>Figure 4: Definition of the tokens
<tr><th>token<th>correspoding string<th>recognised in
<tr><td>COMMENT<td>%<td>repl
<tr><td>PLUS<td>+<td>repl
<tr><td>STRING_OPEN<td>"<td>rep_text
<tr><td>STRING_CLOSE<td>"<td>string

<tr><td>TAGC<td>&gt;<td>starttag, endtag
</table>
</center>
<p>
A <tt>comment</tt> is ignored.
A <tt>start_repl</tt> (<tt>end_rep</tt>) defines the mapping for the named starttag
(<tt>endtag</tt>).
<p>If the first PLUS in a <tt>repl</tt> is present, then the replacement text must
start at the beginning of a line.
<p>If the second PLUS in a <tt>repl</tt> is present, then the replacement text must
be directly followed by a newline in the output.
When both PLUS's are present, the effect is that he replacement text
is on a separate line, apart from its surrounding text, with no empty
lines inserted.
<p>
<tt>rep_text</tt> is the replacement text itself, which consists of any number
of <tt>strings</tt>.
<p>All specified <tt>strings</tt> are concatenated to form the replacement text.
Putting replacement text in several <tt>strings</tt> is only useful to
get a neat layout in the replacement file.
So
<pre>
&lt;table&gt;  ".[keep]\en" ".TS"
</pre>
is identical to
<pre>
&lt;table&gt;  ".[keep]\en"
         ".TS"
</pre>
<p>
The tokens are recognised only within the rule specified in the
third column of the definition of the tokens in figure 4.
There is one exception for the ATT_OPEN token:
ATT_OPEN is never recognised inside the replacement text of an <tt>end_repl</tt>,
because there are no attributes associated with an endtag.
<p>
Within a <tt>string</tt>, characters can be escaped to ensure that they
are recognised as CHARACTER's.
For instance, this can be used to put a '"' in a <tt>string</tt>.
Escape sequences can also be used to denote unprintable characters.
The escape mechanism is similar to that of the C programming language.
The recognised escape-sequences are shown in figure 5.
</p>

<table border=5>
<caption>Figure 5: Recognised escape-sequences
<tr><th>sequence<th>name
<tr><td>\n<td>newline
<tr><td>\t<td>tab
<tr><td>\r<td>return
<tr><td>\s<td>space
<tr><td>\f<td>formfeed
<tr><td>\\<td>\
<tr><td>\[<td>[
<tr><td>\"<td>"
<tr><td>\&lt;number&gt;<td>where &lt;number&gt; is an octal number character with octal value &lt;number&gt;
</table>
</center>
<p>The escape character is defined as '\'.
An escape character followed by a character that is not mentioned
in figure 5, denotes itself.
For example, if the replacement file contains:
<pre>
&lt;report&gt;   "line 1\n\"line 2\"\12line 3"
</pre>
then &lt;report&gt; is replaced by:
<pre>
line 1
"line 2"
line 3
</pre>
<p>See the file 'article.rep' in the distributed sources
for a more complete example of a replacement file.
