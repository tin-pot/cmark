<div class="blogpost"><h2 class="blogposttitle"><a href="http://antirez.com/page/picol.html">picol, a Tcl interpreter in 550 lines of C code </a></h2><div style="clear:both"></div><div class="blogposttext">After I found <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2124">this story</a> on <a href="http://programming.reddit.com/">programming.reddit.com</a> I was too tempted to write a 500 lines of C code Tcl interpreter for fun, as <a href="http://programming.reddit.com/info/1a1zh/comments">commented here</a>. It took three hours of work, <b>556</b> lines of C code, and was pretty interesting to do. The following is a description of the experiment.
<h3>Rules</h3>
I had some rule in mind:
<ul><li>Unlike the <a href="http://www.modeemi.fi/%7Echery/lisp500/">lisp500</a>
 interpreter I wanted to use more or less my normal C style. Lisp500 
isn't actually 500 lines of code, but 500 lines of human gzipped code 
;). In Picol you'll find normal C spacing and even comments.</li>

<li>I wanted to write an interpreter with a design similar to a real 
one. One of the few useful things you can do with picol is to learn how 
to write a Tcl interpreter if you are a newbie programmer I guess, so 
the point was to write a simple to understand program.</li>

<li>The resulting interpreter should be able to run some kind of non 
trivial program, to set few vars and print hello world was not an 
option.</li>

</ul>
<h3>The resulting interpreter: Picol</h3>
<a href="http://antirez.com/picol/picol.c.txt">This is the picol source code</a>,
 that tells very little without to know the supported features. The 
parser is very similar to the Tcl one, Picol supports interpolation as 
well, for example you can write:
<pre class="code">set a "pu"
set b {ts}
$a$b "Hello World!"
</pre>
<b>Note that Picol has an interactive shell!</b> so just launch it without arguments to start to play (to compile just write <i>gcc -O2 -Wall -o picol picol.c</i>).
<br><br>

To run a program stored in a file instead use <i>picol filename.tcl</i>.
<br><br>

Probably the parser should be rewritten in order to take less space, 
currently it takes almost 250 lines of code: this is too much and leaves
 little room for all the rest. A Raw list of the supported features:
<ul><li>Interpolation, as seen above. You can also write "2+2 = [+ 2 2]" or "My name is: $foobar".</li>

<li>Procedures, with return. Like Tcl if return is missing the result of the last command executed is returned.</li>

<li><b>If</b>, <b>if .. else ..</b>, <b>while</b> with <b>break</b> and <b>continue</b></li>

<li>Recursion</li>

<li>Variables inside procedures are limited in scope like Tcl, i.e. there are real call frames in Picol.</li>

<li>The following other commands: <b>set + -</b> * <b>/ == != &gt; &lt; &gt;= &lt;= puts</b></li>

</ul>
This is an example of programs Picol can run:
<pre class="code">proc fib {x} {
    if {&lt;= $x 1} {
        return 1
    } else {
        + [fib [- $x 1]] [fib [- $x 2]]
    }
}<br><br>puts [fib 20]
</pre>
that of course will output fib(20). Another example:
<pre class="code">proc square {x} {
    * $x $x
}<br><br>set a 1
while {&lt;= $a 10} {
    if {== $a 5} {
        puts {Missing five!}
        set a [+ $a 1]
        continue
    }
    puts "I can compute that $a*$a = [square $a]"
    set a [+ $a 1]
}
</pre>
<h3>Design</h3>
It's pretty straightforward, the first important part you see in the source code
is an hand written parser. The main function of the parser is <b>picolGetToken</b> that just calls functions able to parse the different parts of a Tcl program and return in the parsing structure the type of the token and start/end pointers in order to extract it.
<br><br>

This function is in turn used by <b>picolEval</b> in order to execute the program. Every token is used either to form a new argument if a separator token was found before, or concatenated to the last argument (this is how interpolation is performed in Picol). Once an EOL (end of line) token is returned <b>picolEval</b> will call the command looking it up in a linked list of commands stored inside the interpreter structure.
<br><br>

Variables and commands substitution is performed by <b>picolEval</b> itself. The parser is able to return variables and commands tokens already stripped by $ and [], so all it's required to do is to lookup the variable in the call frame and substitute the value with the token, or to recursively call <b>picolEval</b> if it's a command substitution, using the result instead of the original token.
<br><br>

Commands are described by a name and a pointer to a C function implementing the command. In the command structure there is also a <b>private data</b> void pointer used in order to store data private to the command. This makes you able to implement multiple Picol commands using a single C function. User defined procedures are just like commands, but they are implemented by passing as private data the argument list and the body of the procedure, so a single C function is able to implement all the existing user defined procedures.
<br><br>

Procedures call is trivial. The interpreter structure contains a call frame structure having more or less just a pointer to a liked list of variables (that are in turn structures with two fileds: name and value). When a procedure is called a new call frame is created and put at the top of the old one. When the procedure returns the top call frame is destroyed.
<h3>Next steps</h3>
I'll hardly find more time to hack on Picol but with other 100 lines of code it is possible to write [eval], [uplevel] and a minimal support for Tcl lists. This could make the interpreter much more useful, assuming this kind of minimal interpreters have some kind of usefulness at all ;)
<br><br>

Actually what I want to do one of this days is to redesign it to make the parser smaller and simpler to read, and at the same time to make space for <b>uplevel</b>, <b>lindex</b>, <b>lappend</b>, <b>lset</b> and a few of string commands.
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
Writing interpreters is fun, but trying to write a small one in C makes very clear how much of C code is memory management, pointers exercise in order to parse strings, and implementation of trivial data structures like linked lists for the lack of some kind of dictionaries-alike data structure in the C library. Probably Picol can be rewritten in a dynamic language like Ruby or Tcl itself in 200 lines of code.
